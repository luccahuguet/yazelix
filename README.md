## Overview
Yazelix integrates Yazi, Zellij, and Helix, hence the name, get it?

- **Use your preferred shell**: Bash, Fish, Zsh, or Nushell - Yazelix works with all of them
- Zellij orchestrates everything, with Yazi as a sidebar and your chosen editor (Helix by default)
- To hide the sidebar, make your pane fullscreen! (`Ctrl p + f` or `Alt Shift f`)
- Every keybinding from Zellij that conflicts with Helix is remapped [see here](#keybindings)
- When you hit Enter on a file/folder in the "sidebar":
  - **With Helix**: If Helix is already open in the topmost pane of the stack, it opens that file/folder in a new buffer in Helix. If Helix isn't open, it launches Helix in a new pane for you. It always finds a running Helix instance if it exists and is in the top pane of the stacked group.
  - **With other editors**: Opens the file in a new pane with your configured editor
  - It automatically renames the Zellij tab to the file's underlying Git repo or directory name
- Features include:
  - "Reveal file in sidebar" (press `Alt y` in Helix to reveal the file in Yazi, `Alt y` in Yazi to focus Helix, see [Keybindings](#keybindings))
  - A Yazi plugin to enhance the status bar in the sidebar pane, making it uncluttered, colorful, and showing file permissions
  - A [Git plugin](https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/git.yazi) showing file changes in the Yazi sidebar
  - Dynamic column updates in Yazi (parent, current, preview) via the [auto-layout plugin](https://github.com/luccahuguet/auto-layout.yazi), perfect for sidebar use
  - **Modular editor support**: Use Helix for full integration features, or any other editor via the `editor_command` setting
- This project includes config files for Zellij, Yazi, terminal emulators, Nushell scripts, Lua plugins, and a lot of love
- See [boot sequence](./docs/boot_sequence.md) for details on how Yazelix starts up

## Why Yazelix
Yazelix is a reproducible terminal IDE that integrates Yazi + Zellij + Helix. It delivers a consistent, fast ‚Äúsuperterminal‚Äù locally or over SSH with zero manual setup: smart pane/layout orchestration, sidebar reveal/open flows, curated packs, and sane defaults. It also solves helix/zellij keybinding conflicts (no need to ever lock zellij), auto‚Äëconfigures great tools like starship, zoxide, carapace (that normally require editing shell config files), and includes many tools from the Yazelix Collection, like lazygit

It already comes with cool zellij and yazi plugins, some of which I maintain myself

It has features like `reveal in Yazi` (from Helix) and opening files from Yazi in your configured editor

Supports top terminals (Ghostty, WezTerm, Kitty, Alacritty) and popular shells (Bash, Zsh, Fish, Nushell). Easy to configure via a single Nix file with sensible defaults

Get everything running in less than 10 minutes. No extra dependencies, only Nix

Install once, get the same environment everywhere

## Vision
- Using the terminal should be easy, beautiful, practical and reproducible
- Good defaults over customization. Have both when possible
- Yazelix is always on the edge of project versions
- Yazelix is always evolving, it's a living being
- What is even Yazelix?
- Yazelix lets you say `I use Yazelix btw`
- Boy, do we Nix
- Integration, integration, integration
- Follows the [Omakase](https://learn.omacom.io/3/omacom/76/omakase-computing) principle like [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/)
- Made with love.

- See the version compatibility table [here](./docs/version_table.md) (generated dynamically!)

## Installation

üìñ **[Complete Installation Guide ‚Üí](./docs/installation.md)** - Detailed step-by-step setup instructions

**Quick Overview**: Yazelix uses Nix for reproducible, reliable installations that guarantee everyone gets the exact same tool versions. You don't need to learn Nix - just install it once and forget it exists!

## Quick Setup

1. Install Nix
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

2. Install Nushell (required)
```bash
nix profile add nixpkgs#nushell
```
Other platforms: see https://www.nushell.sh/book/installation.html

3. Clone Yazelix
```bash
git clone https://github.com/luccahuguet/yazelix ~/.config/yazelix
```

4. Install fonts (for Kitty/Alacritty)
```bash
nix profile add nixpkgs#nerd-fonts.fira-code nixpkgs#nerd-fonts.symbols-only
```

5. Copy terminal config (optional)
See [Step 5 in installation guide](./docs/installation.md#step-5-set-up-yazelix-to-auto-launch-in-your-terminal)

6. Launch
```bash
nu ~/.config/yazelix/nushell/scripts/core/start_yazelix.nu
```

### Helix Integration
For Helix-Yazi integration, add this to your Helix config (`~/.config/helix/config.toml`):

```toml
[keys.normal]
# Yazelix sidebar integration - reveal current file in Yazi sidebar
A-y = ":sh nu ~/.config/yazelix/nushell/scripts/integrations/reveal_in_yazi.nu \"%{buffer_name}\""
```

üìñ **[Complete Helix Keybindings Guide ‚Üí](./docs/keybindings.md)** - Recommended keybindings for enhanced editing experience (git blame!)

## Version Check
Check installed tool versions:
```bash
nu nushell/scripts/utils/version_info.nu
```

## Helix Pane Detection Logic

When opening files from Yazi, Yazelix will:
- Check the topmost pane and the next two below for a zellij pane named `editor` (which will be the Helix pane).
- If Helix is found, it is moved to the top and reused; if not, a new Helix pane is opened.
- This is need because sometimes when opening a new zellij pane in the pane stack, or deleting one, the editor pane will move around. Most of the times it will move down twice! So the workaround works.

## Version History & Changelog

For a detailed history of all major Yazelix version bumps and changelogs, see [Version History](./docs/history.md).

## POSIX/XDG Paths

Yazelix respects XDG directories for config, data, state, and cache. See POSIX/XDG Paths for details: ./docs/posix_xdg.md

## SSH / Remote

Yazelix shines over SSH: the TUI stack (Zellij, Yazi, Helix) runs cleanly without any GUI, giving you a fully configured, consistent ‚Äúsuperterminal‚Äù on barebones hosts (for example, an AWS EC2 instance). The flake delivers the same tools, keybindings, and layouts you use locally, minimizing drift on ephemeral servers.

## Customization & Configuration

Yazelix uses a **layered configuration system** that safely merges your personal settings with Yazelix defaults:

- **Core settings**: Edit `~/.config/yazelix/yazelix.nix` for shell, editor, terminal, and package preferences
- **Tool customization**: Add personal overrides in `configs/yazi/personal/` or `configs/zellij/personal/` directories 
- **Your configs persist** across Yazelix updates without git conflicts
- **Intelligent merging**: TOML sections merge properly, avoiding duplicate keys and conflicts

üìñ **[Complete Customization Guide ‚Üí](./docs/customization.md)** - Detailed instructions for customizing every tool

### Editor Configuration

üìù **[Editor Configuration Guide ‚Üí](./docs/editor_configuration.md)** - Complete guide for configuring editors

**Quick setup:**
- **Default (recommended)**: `editor_command = null` - Uses yazelix's Helix, no conflicts
- **System Helix**: `editor_command = "hx"` - Requires matching `helix_runtime_path` 
- **Other editors**: `editor_command = "nvim"` - Basic integration, loses Helix features

### Alternative: CLI-Only Mode
To use Yazelix tools without starting the full interface (no sidebar, no Zellij), use:
```bash
yzx env
```
This loads all tools (helix, yazi, lazygit, etc.) into your current shell, with Yazelix env vars set and clean messaging, and automatically launches the shell configured in your `yazelix.nix`. Prefer the legacy behavior? Run `yzx env --no-shell` to stay in your current shell.

If you prefer a raw Nix shell, you can use:
```bash
nix develop --impure ~/.config/yazelix
```

**Customize Your Installation:**
If you followed [step 3 in the installation guide](./docs/installation.md#step-3-configure-your-installation-optional), you already have your `~/.config/yazelix/yazelix.nix` config file ready! You can modify it anytime and restart Yazelix to apply changes. See [yazelix_default.nix](./yazelix_default.nix) for all available options and their descriptions.

**Terminal Emulator Selection:**
- **Ghostty** (default): Modern, fast terminal written in Zig with great performance
  - **Linux**: Provided by Yazelix via Nix
  - **macOS**: Install via Homebrew: `brew install --cask ghostty` (Nix doesn't support macOS app bundles)
- **WezTerm** (recommended fallback): Works on both platforms via Nix, best image preview support in Yazi
- **Kitty**: Fast, feature-rich, GPU-accelerated terminal (works on both platforms)
- **Alacritty**: Fast, GPU-accelerated terminal written in Rust
- **Foot**: Wayland-native terminal (Linux-only)
- **Auto-detection**: If preferred terminal not found, fallback order is: ghostty ‚Üí wezterm ‚Üí kitty ‚Üí alacritty ‚Üí foot
- Configure your preference in `yazelix.nix` with `preferred_terminal = "terminal_name"`
- **Bundled terminals**: On Linux, Yazelix provides GPU-accelerated wrappers (`yazelix-ghostty`, `yazelix-kitty`, etc.) via Nix. On macOS, install your preferred terminal via Homebrew or system package manager.

## Home Manager Integration

Yazelix includes optional Home Manager support for declarative configuration management. See [home_manager/README.md](home_manager/README.md) for setup instructions.

## Notes
- The `--impure` flag in `nix develop` allows access to the HOME environment variable, necessary for config paths
- Tweak configs to make them yours; this is just a starting point! 
- For extra configuration, see: [WezTerm Docs](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/config/files.html)
- Add more swap layouts as needed using the KDL files in `configs/zellij/layouts`
- Use `lazygit`, it's great

## When should you not use yazelix?
- If you hate having fun
- If you suffer from a severe case of nix-allergy

## Initializer Scripts
Yazelix auto-generates initialization scripts for Starship, Zoxide, Mise, and Carapace for your configured default shell, regenerated every startup. See [docs/initializer_scripts.md](./docs/initializer_scripts.md) for details.

## Styling and Themes
Yazelix includes transparency settings and theme configurations for a beautiful terminal experience. The terminal emulator configs include transparency settings you can comment/uncomment, and Helix comes with transparent theme options. See [docs/styling.md](./docs/styling.md) for customization details.

For Helix themes, you can use transparent themes by editing your Helix config:
```toml
# theme = "base16_transparent"
theme = "term16_dark"  # Recommended transparent theme
```

## Layouts
Yazelix includes adaptive layouts that organize your workspace. Use `three_column` for Claude Code and AI tools, and more. See [docs/layouts.md](./docs/layouts.md) for details and customization.

## Keybindings
Keybindings are discoverable in each tool (e.g., `~` in Yazi, `?` in lazygit). See [docs/keybindings.md](./docs/keybindings.md) for full details, custom keybindings, and usage tips.


## I'm Lost! Too Much Information
Start by learning Zellij on its own, then optionally Yazi, and re-read this README afterwards
