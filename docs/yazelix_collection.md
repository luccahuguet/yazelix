# Yazelix Collection

Yazelix is built on the shoulders of giants. Here are the projects, tools, and plugins that Yazelix integrates with or is inspired by, organized to match the Yazelix configuration structure. Each entry links to the project's homepage or repository and includes a description of its role in Yazelix.

## Integration Levels

**Deep Integration** (ðŸš€ deep-integration): Essential tools like Yazi, Zellij, and Helix have custom configurations, keybindings, and scripts that make them work seamlessly together.

**Pre-configured** (ðŸ”§ auto-configured): Tools with custom Yazelix configurations, shell initializers, or special setup.

**Curated Recommendations**: High-quality tools included in `yazelix_default.nix` as optional packages. These can be easily enabled/disabled by uncommenting/commenting them in your config - **Yazelix doesn't have special integration with most of these projects**. They're just excellent tools we recommend!
